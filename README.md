# AUR Packages

A bunch of AUR packages made or forked by me. Those that are forks are located
in the `contrib` directory. Most of my forks are usually version upgrades or
build fixes.

All of these AUR packages are wrappers over the actual software. If I ever
write software that will end up in AUR, I'll store the `PKGBUILD` files there.
An example would be
[python-license](https://github.com/codemonkey800/python-license).

## Emoji index
I've recently started using Emojis in a lot of my commit messages, READMEs, and
wherever I can on GitHub. Here's what each emoji I use represents. It may be
subject to change:

- :tada: - Commits that include something so amazing that I have to celebrate :tada:
- :wrench: - Commits that are relatively small to medium in size
- :warning: - Commits that introduce configs or code that break things
